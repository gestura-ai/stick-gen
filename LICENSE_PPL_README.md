# Stick-Gen License Overview – PPL-3% (Gestura AI Variant)

This document explains how the Prosocial Public License – PPL-3%
("PPL-3%") applies to the Stick-Gen project. It is an informal
summary; the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file is the binding legal text.

> Note: This is not legal advice. Please consult your own counsel for
> legal questions or contractual use.

## Who Needs to Pay?

You **do not owe any payment** under the PPL-3% if **any** of the
following are true:

- Your organization’s global annual gross revenue is **≤ USD $1,000,000**;
- You use Stick-Gen only for **non-commercial research**, education,
  experimentation, or evaluation;
- You use Stick-Gen only in **open-source projects** that themselves do
  not directly generate revenue.

You **may owe a 3% share** if **both** of the following are true:

- Your global annual gross revenue is **> USD $1,000,000**; and
- You use Stick-Gen in **revenue-generating products or services**
  ("Commercial Use" in the LICENSE).

In that case, you are a **Qualifying User** and must either:

1. Pay **3% of Attributable Revenue** related to Stick-Gen, using an
   approved funding mechanism; or
2. Obtain a separate commercial license from Gestura AI that modifies
   or waives this obligation.

"Attributable Revenue" means the portion of your annual gross revenue
that is reasonably attributable to products or services that
incorporate or depend on Stick-Gen.

## How to Comply (High-Level)

1. **At fiscal year-end**, determine whether your organization’s global
   annual gross revenue exceeded **USD $1,000,000**.
2. If yes, determine whether you used Stick-Gen in any
   revenue-generating products or services during that year.
3. Estimate, in good faith, the portion of that revenue reasonably
   attributable to Stick-Gen (Attributable Revenue).
4. Compute **3% of Attributable Revenue**.
5. Choose a payment channel as described in `LICENSE` §4, for example:
   - GitHub Sponsors to Gestura AI (e.g.
     `https://github.com/sponsors/gestura-ai`), or
   - A non-profit foundation or fiscal sponsor designated at
     `https://gestura.ai`.
6. Make the payment and keep internal records of your calculation.
7. Optionally, send a brief statement (company, fiscal year,
   Attributable Revenue estimate, amount paid, and payment channel) to
   a contact address listed at `https://gestura.ai`.

## Exemptions and Friendly Uses

The license is explicitly designed so that the following uses **do not
incur payment** under PPL-3% (subject to complying with the other
license terms):

- **Academic research and teaching**;
- **Non-profit organizations** using Stick-Gen in non-commercial
  contexts;
- **Individual developers and small teams** below the $1M revenue
  threshold;
- **Open-source projects** that incorporate Stick-Gen but do not
  directly sell products or services based on it.

You may still need to comply with other terms (attribution, sharing
modifications, etc.), but the 3% revenue share does **not** apply to
these scenarios.

## Legacy MIT Code and Transition

Earlier versions or portions of Stick-Gen may have been released under
the MIT License. The new PPL-3% License **does not retroactively
revoke** any rights that were validly granted under a prior MIT
license.

Gestura AI may:

- Maintain documentation (and optionally a `LICENSE-MIT-LEGACY` file)
  indicating which historical releases or files are under MIT; and
- Apply PPL-3% to **new high-value components** going forward, such as
  advanced generation pipelines, evaluation tools, or agentic
  integrations.

If you are relying on explicitly MIT-licensed versions or files,
those MIT rights remain in force for that material, as described in the
`LICENSE` section on Legacy MIT Versions.

## Dual Licensing and Commercial Agreements

If you prefer traditional commercial terms (for example, no
revenue-share obligation, different reporting terms, or broader
indemnities), Gestura AI can offer a separate **commercial license**
for Stick-Gen.

Such agreements may include:

- Royalty-free (non PPL-3%) terms with a negotiated fee;
- Custom compliance or audit provisions;
- Integration with a broader commercial relationship.

Contact details and available options will be published at
`https://gestura.ai`.

## Rationale and Expected Impact

The PPL-3% model is intended to make Stick-Gen:

- **Freely usable** by researchers, hobbyists, and early-stage teams;
- **Economically sustainable** when adopted by larger companies that
  build successful commercial products on top of it.

Based on internal projections (e.g., scaling to 10k+ end deployments
per year and hybrid revenue models that add roughly 10–15% uplift), a
modest 3% share from successful commercial reuses could generate on the
order of **$50k–$200k/year by Year 3**. Gestura AI intends to reinvest
these funds into:

- Predictive and expressive gesture models;
- 2.5D/3D parallax rendering and camera tooling;
- Voice and multimodal interfaces;
- Safety, evaluation, and developer experience.

This helps keep Stick-Gen competitive with proprietary offerings while
remaining open, research-friendly, and aligned with prosocial
principles.
