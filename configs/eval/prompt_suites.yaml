The detective, sensing something, spins around quickly. The two figures face each other. Tension builds. The detective takes a step forward. The shadowy figure takes a step back. They circle each other slowly. Finally, the detective extends a hand, offering a handshake. The shadowy figure hesitates, then reaches out. They shake hands firmly."
