Prosocial Public License – PPL‑3% (Gestura AI / Stick‑Gen Variant)
Version 1.0 – January 2026

Copyright (c) 2025–2026 Gestura AI
All rights reserved except as expressly granted below.

Preamble
--------

Stick‑Gen is an open generative framework for synthesizing expressive,
physics‑aware stick‑figure motion. This Prosocial Public License (PPL‑3%)
is designed to:

  • Enable generous open use by individuals, researchers, and early‑stage
    teams; and

  • Require successful commercial users above a defined revenue threshold
    to share a small portion of value (3%) back to support ongoing R&D on
    Stick‑Gen and related tooling.

By using, copying, modifying, or distributing this software, you accept
this License.

This License is not legal advice. You should consult with your own legal
counsel before relying on it.

1. Definitions
--------------

“Project” means the Stick‑Gen motion generation framework and associated
code and documentation in this repository that Gestura AI designates as
licensed under this Prosocial Public License – PPL‑3% (the “License”).

“You” (or “Your”) means an individual or legal entity exercising
permissions under this License.

“Commercial Use” means use of the Project in or for the provision of
products or services for which You or Your affiliates receive monetary
or other commercial value.

“Attributable Revenue” means the portion of Your annual gross revenue
reasonably attributable to products or services that incorporate or
depend on the Project.

“Qualifying User” means any You whose global annual gross revenue from
all activities exceeds USD $1,000,000 in a given fiscal year and that
engages in Commercial Use of the Project in that year.

“Legacy MIT Versions” means any prior tagged releases or commits of this
repository that Gestura AI has explicitly identified as licensed under
the MIT License.

2. Grant of Rights
------------------

Subject to the conditions in this License, Gestura AI hereby grants You
a worldwide, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable, royalty‑free (except as
set forth in Section 3), irrevocable license to:

  • use, copy, and run the Project;
  • create derivative works of the Project;
  • distribute the Project and derivative works; and
  • host or make available the Project as part of a service,

in source or object form, for any purpose, including Commercial Use.

3. Prosocial Revenue Share (PPL‑3%)
-----------------------------------

3.1 Non‑Qualifying Users (below threshold).
If You are not a Qualifying User, You may exercise all rights granted in
Section 2 without owing any payment under this Section 3, subject to the
other conditions in this License.

3.2 Qualifying Users (above threshold).
If You are a Qualifying User and engage in Commercial Use of the
Project during any fiscal year, You must either:

  (a) Remit to Gestura AI, or to a designated non‑profit or foundation
      controlled by Gestura AI, an amount equal to **3% (three percent)**
      of Attributable Revenue for that year (“PPL‑3% Share”); or

  (b) Obtain a separate written commercial license from Gestura AI that
      supersedes or modifies this obligation.

3.3 Revenue threshold.
For clarity, the PPL‑3% Share applies only if both (i) Your global
annual gross revenue from all activities exceeds USD $1,000,000 in the
relevant fiscal year and (ii) You engage in Commercial Use of the
Project in that year.

4. Funding Mechanisms
---------------------

4.1 Approved mechanisms.
Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the PPL‑3% Share may be satisfied by
making annual payments via one or more of the following mechanisms:

  • GitHub Sponsors or equivalent platforms to Gestura AI
    (for example: https://github.com/sponsors/gestura-ai); or

  • Direct contributions to a non‑profit foundation or fiscal sponsor
    publicly designated by Gestura AI at https://gestura.ai as an
    approved PPL funding recipient; or

  • Any other mechanism expressly approved in writing by Gestura AI.

4.2 Use of funds.
Gestura AI intends (but is not legally obligated) to direct PPL‑3%
funds primarily to research and development related to Stick‑Gen,
including predictive gestures, 2.5D/3D rendering, multimodal
conditioning, voice and agentic interfaces, and safety tooling.

5. Non‑Commercial, Research, and OSS Uses
-----------------------------------------

Academic institutions, non‑profit organizations, individuals, and open‑
source projects that use the Project for non‑commercial research,
education, experimentation, or open‑source development do not owe any
payment under Section 3, regardless of revenue, provided that they
comply with the other terms of this License.

6. Source Availability and Reciprocity
--------------------------------------

If You distribute the Project or derivative works of the Project, You
must:

  • include a copy of this License; and
  • clearly indicate any modifications You have made; and
  • license such modifications to the Project under this same License.

This Section does not require You to open‑source Your entire product,
only the portions of code that are derivative works of the Project.

7. Dual Licensing and Exceptions
--------------------------------

Gestura AI may, at its sole discretion, offer separate commercial
licenses with different terms (including royalty‑free licenses) to
individuals or organizations that prefer not to be bound by the PPL‑3%
Share. Any such agreement must be in writing and will govern to the
extent of any conflict with this License.

8. Governance and PPL Ecosystem
-------------------------------

Gestura AI intends to align this License with the broader Prosocial
Public License (PPL) ecosystem and may participate in or reference a
membership‑based non‑profit entity that provides policy guidance and
legal support for PPL‑style licenses. Such alignment does not limit the
rights granted to You under this License.

9. Legacy MIT Versions
----------------------

Nothing in this License is intended to retroactively revoke or limit
rights that were validly granted under the MIT License for any Legacy
MIT Versions. To the extent any file, release, or commit has been
explicitly identified by Gestura AI as licensed under the MIT License,
Your rights under that MIT grant remain in effect for that material.

10. Termination
----------------

If You materially breach this License and fail to cure such breach
within thirty (30) days after receiving written notice from Gestura AI,
Your rights under this License automatically terminate. Upon
termination, You must cease all use and distribution of the Project,
but this does not affect rights You granted to others in compliance
with this License prior to termination.

11. Disclaimer of Warranty
--------------------------

THE PROJECT IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY
CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,
TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE
PROJECT OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE PROJECT.
