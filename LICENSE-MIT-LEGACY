MIT License (Legacy Versions)

This file documents the use of the MIT License for certain historical
versions or components of the Stick-Gen project.

The root of this repository is now licensed under the
"Prosocial Public License – PPL-3% (Gestura AI / Stick-Gen Variant)"
as described in the LICENSE file. However, some earlier versions or
specific files may have been released under the MIT License. For those
materials, the original MIT grant continues to apply.

## 1. Legacy MIT Grant

For any release, commit, or file that was explicitly published under
the MIT License before the adoption of PPL-3%, the following license
terms remain in force for that material:

````text
MIT License

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal
in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights
to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell
copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all
copies or substantial portions of the Software.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,
OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE
SOFTWARE.
````

Nothing in the newer PPL-3% license is intended to revoke or limit these
rights for Legacy MIT Versions.

## 2. Identifying Legacy MIT Versions

Over time, Gestura AI may publish documentation indicating which tags,
releases, or files are considered "Legacy MIT Versions" (for example,
by annotating Git tags or adding notes to release descriptions).

Until such a catalog is formally published, downstream users who
obtained the project under the MIT License may continue to rely on that
license for the relevant versions or files they received.

---

## 3. PPL-3% for New Work

New work, features, and files added after the adoption of the
PPL-3% license are intended to be covered by the Prosocial Public
License – PPL-3% (Gestura AI / Stick-Gen Variant), subject to any
explicit exceptions or dual-licensing agreements made by Gestura AI.

See the LICENSE and LICENSE_PPL_README.md files for details on the
current primary license and how the PPL-3% model applies.
